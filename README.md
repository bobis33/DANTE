# # EPITECH PROJECT | ELEMENTARY_PROGRAMMING (Dante)

<br> <br/>

#### Dante must journey through Hell, a thoroughly maze-like place. Here we’re going to generate mazes, find
the exit path and try to do this as fast as possible.

The project is divided into nine sections, which represent the nine circles of Hell that Dante must pass
through in order to reach purgatory.

The goal of this project is to generate mazes (in a reasonable amount of time), solve them (in a reasonable
amount of time), and print the solution.

See the subject for further details !
